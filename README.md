# [DEMO LINK](https://IOherhi.github.io/game-2048/)

This is a browser implementation of the popular 2048 game, created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. All game logic is encapsulated in a single class that follows object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## What this game does:

Creates a 4x4 game board.

Generates initial tiles with numbers 2 or 4.

Allows moving tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

Automatically merges tiles with the same values.

Updates the score whenever tiles merge.

Displays "Game Over" when no more moves are possible.

Updates the DOM to reflect the current game state.

## Technologies:

JavaScript (ES6) — all logic is implemented inside the Game class, which contains methods for:

creating and initializing the board,

generating new tiles,

handling movement and merging,

checking for game over,

updating the DOM.

HTML — page structure with the game board.

CSS — styling the game, including animations for tile movement.

## Features:

Implemented following Object-Oriented Programming principles.

All logic encapsulated in one class — easy to scale or refactor.

Fully browser-based game — no external libraries or frameworks needed.

Supports keyboard control (arrow keys).
